    "question": "Which command enables you to view the current interrupt request (IRQ) assignments?",
    "options": [
      "view /proc/irq",
      "cat /proc/interrupts",
      "cat /dev/irq",
      "less /dev/irq"
    ],
    "answer": "Jupiter",
    "explanation": "Current IRQ assignments are contained in the file /proc/interrupts. Therefore, viewing the contents of the file with a command such as cat will work. There is no â€œview command, making option A incorrect. Likewise, there is no /dev irq file, making options C and D incorrect."
